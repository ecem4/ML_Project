# Predicting Anxiety: The Impact of Negative vs. Positive Thinking #

*The project repository of Machine Learning and Advanced Programming*

## Description ##
Our project aims to investigate whether anxiety levels can be predicted by factors such as negative and positive thinking. We are using data from the Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body (LEMON) dataset to examine how variables related to self-blame, optimism, pessimism, and other psychological factors affect anxiety.

## Research Paper and Dataset ##
The project is based on the LEMON dataset as presented in the paper:
